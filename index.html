  <a href="#" class="active">Journal 📓</a>
  <a href="#">Day 1: "Very eager to get back to this medit./ calm & happy after."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 2: "I was a mite anxious & at same time confident i would do it just fine. Feel good , calm, capable and 'in order'."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 3: "It was a struggle at first because i must go to breakfast...however as i went through the medit i was grateful for this STOP to my 'all over the place' thoughts.  NOW..FEEL MUCH BETTER, BREATHING IS EASIER.."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 4: "Med.= feeling satisfied that i decided to Do This Now. .before moving on to the business of the day..💟..i love myself in a forgiving way and am calm, clear-headed to do things."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 5: "I feel so much calmer. Have the vision you mentioned that You have of me sitting on a bench : just being in the moment.😊💞🌊 so lovely and caring for myself."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 6: "i felt pretty glad to sit down to do meditation. My body scan was interesting..i felt a pain in my scalp (top rightside), i forgot to notice how my fingers & toes felt / my mind did a lot of wandering / had to keep bringing it back. The breathing count started well. .but also got distracted. I'm a LOT more tolerant of noises - outside & inside the flat."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 7: "I am glad, grateful to have done Day7...after 3 attempts from 8am till 15h40 ! That last was on the stoep at Veronica's...so lovely & peaceful....could hear the river ! Didn't finish that cos fell asleep ! Now i am calm for sleep. Satisfied i DID it."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 7 (again): "This time I'm not tired.  I felt frustrated that I'd wasted time this morning...however the Meditation told me to 'let it go' : i did. ..and it worked 😌  I'm feeling so much better. Able to make sensible choices of what to do next. I've a full list of To Do's but now I'm at peace that the order of DOING them can be logical but also flexible. Sigh of relief."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 8: "I'm alone; TV is off; just the ticking of a clock and gentle hum of cars now n then. Wonderful. This was so much.more aware."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 9: "I feel more prepared to do all that has suddenly been 'dumped onto my plate'. I wasn't feeling resentful but was a bit annoyed.  Now i feel able to cheerfully tackle One Thing at A Time 😉."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 10: "I just did my daily meditation 🙂 I felt so happy. reflected many of the feelings I'm experiencing this morning. Letting these feelings 'come & go' has been an awareness journey."</a>
  <a href="#">Day 11: "I'm amazed at my eagerness to Do This next Stage.  15mins will not be a problem for me. 💫 my motivation is to achieve a better state of Calm; to be slow to decide what the Day's Plan should be;   to be both flexible AND honourable towards those who provide my sustinance; as well as those who request help from me; as well as being aware of people 'in my path' along the way-of-the-day; AND as well,  of my own health of body & mind. To enter a realm of Order & self-discipline..will be stepping onto a different PATH IN MY LIFE.  It will,  i expect,  free me.💟🤟🏻⚖"</a>
  <a href="#">Day 12: "Done. Sitting. Reflecting how it feels to consider those i love & like and to send thoughts of Calmness ti them: you, Joanna, Patience ( waiting for me at the Clinic), one if my Al-A friends and Garrick (AA- his mom answered his phonecall after nearly 3yrs of silence from her.) . i checked sounds: clock ticking, traffic , birds. I examined my feelings of 'how it feels' to take 15mins of calm-connection out of my day:  it feels to ME that i added TIME to my day.☺🐌🐚"</a>
  <a href="#">Day 13: "It was a bit rocky ti start...i kept jumping up to do something, get a blanket for warmth, put on the heater, etc until the guide said ! "Don't worry if you are a bit restless...just keep coming back to settle.! After that i stayed put. My motivation was to think well of those close to my heart; to wish them calm & peace. So i thought of Debby and Veronica struggling to juggle work and mothering..( i witnessed their struggles today😑) and Joanna feeling lonely...and you struggling with your routine-committment. The breathing part is much smoother & more focused. I enjoyed it. 🌻"</a>
  <a href="#">Day 14: "My feelings were a mixed bag: a tad annoyed that I'd let it get so late in the day;  & relieved that i Did stop what I've been doing to Do it.  I got annoyed that the Guide's voice is so low even though i checked my Sound Settings... But his beginning & end volumes are loud & normal...just is dripping his level during Time.!  So, i ask myself "How important is it ?"  & that helps me to accept this fact. 😉I'm now lots calmer & prepared to run off & di as mych as i can on my List of To Do's.😉🌻🌻🏃🏼‍♀"</a>
  <a href="#">Day 15: "I was also so tired & very restless. In fact i couldn't sit...had to lie down on the hard cushions of the cane settee. It was fine. I didn't fuss. I related to all the guidence. However my mind wanted to wander so I let it."</a>
